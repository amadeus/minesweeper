# Windows 3.1 Minesweeper

Still a few more things to do, but the main game cycle is in place.

You can check out a recent version of it [here](https://minesweeper-amadeus.vercel.app/).

## Development

If you want to play around with this, feel free.  Just run a quick:

```
npm install
```

to get all your dependencies in place, followed by a yung:

```
npm start
```

to run the local dev server and be able to tube.

If you'd like to run a quick TypeScript check:

```
npm run tsc
```

## Todo

* Custom Game configuration
* Improve mobile support? Maybe?
* Bugs? Probably
